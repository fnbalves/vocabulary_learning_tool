# Vocabulary learning tool

This tool aims to help memorizing vocabulary and gender differences amoung different foreign languages.

# Adding new words 

First, put a image of each one of the words you want to practice inside a folder named *vocabulary_folder*, that should be at the same folder where the application is running. The image should be named as following:

``
[Gender indicator][space][Name of the image]
``

For example, for german, if i wanted to add the word "Chair", I could create an image called "Der Stuhl.PNG". The software will separate the image name using the space to fetch the gender indicator.

# Features

Currently, there are two games implemented. At the first one, the player must guess the correct word for a picture, and at the second one, the player must guess the gender indicator. (For example, Der, Die and Das for German)
